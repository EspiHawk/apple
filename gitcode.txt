git init -- starts git
git add filename.type -- add the doc to stage for future commit to code
git commit -- commits the code
git commit -m "type in commit notes here"
git branch -M main -- make a new branch. main can be called whatever
git remote add origin https://address.get -- done once per project to connect local and web gits 
git push -u otigin main -- works with top command but after you will just use
git push

git fetch origin: Think of this as checking for updates. It’s like when your phone notifies you that app updates are available. You have the new information, but it hasn’t been installed yet.
git merge origin/main or git merge origin/master: This is like actually installing those updates on your phone. The new changes from the remote repository are integrated into your current working branch.
